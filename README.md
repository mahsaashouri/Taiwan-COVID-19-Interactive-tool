# Taiwan-COVID-19-Interactive-tool
The COVID-19 data analysis is essential for policymakers to analyze the outbreak and manage the containment. Here, we propose a web-based interactive tool to cluster and forecast the available data of Taiwan COVID-19 confirmed infection cases. We apply the Model-based (MOB) tree and domain-relevant attributes to cluster the dataset and display forecasting results using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. 
Our applied dataset is "covid19_tw.csv"
