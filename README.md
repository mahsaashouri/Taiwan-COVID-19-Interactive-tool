# Taiwan-COVID-19-Interactive-tool
The COVID-19 data analysis is essential for policymakers to analyze the outbreak and manage the containment. Here, we propose a web-based interactive tool to cluster and forecast the available data of Taiwan COVID-19 confirmed infection cases. We apply the Model-based (MOB) tree and domain-relevant attributes to cluster the dataset and display forecasting results using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. 
Our dataset is ``covid19_tw.csv'' which shows the daily Taiwan COVID-19 confirmed cases in different cities from 2021-01-01 to 2021-06-04. Domain-relevant attributes applied to this dataset include geographical division, `region' (6 categories), `administrative' (3 categories),  `population' (numeric), `imported' (2 categories) and `airport' (2 categories).
